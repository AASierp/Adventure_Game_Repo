Intro

You wake up in a mysterious wood, you have no recollection of how you got here. Upon surveying your surroundings you see a small 
rucksack lying on the ground next to you. Upon searching it, the only item you find is a MAP scrawled on a bit of parchment. 
The MAP seems to indicate your location as well as a Castle to north west. It appears that who left the map wants you to make 
your way to there. You put the rucksack on your back a start looking for a path out of the wood. It appears as though you can 
travel to the East or to the West. The way south is blocked by a high sheer cliff face and the way North is bordered by a deep stream. 

SouthWest6: 

You travel some fifty yards down a dirt path through the woods and emerge into a clearing. You immediately notice a lumberjack 
sitting on the ground on the other side of the clearing, his leg appears to be caught in a bear trap. You can HELP him out of 
the trap or you can go back East, the way you came.

HELP - 

You make your way over to the woodcutter and help him pry the trap from his leg. He is so grateful for your assistance that he 
insists that you take his axe as a reward! After helping him to his feet and supplying him with a walking stick, he thanks you
 again and makes his way into the woods. You add the hatchet to your ruck and set about deciding where to go from here. 
 Unfortunately, it appears as though you can only go back East, the way you came, as the river still flows to the north, 
 the cliff continues to the south and further west is a straight drop down over a hundred feet!

SouthEast8:

The path leads to yet another dead end. Cliff to the south, river to the north and impenetrable dense jungle further east. 
While carefully surveying the area, you notice notice a large tree leaning over the river to the north. If only out had some way 
cutting it down or knocking it over. Better look elsewhere.

CUT -
After a solid hour of hard work, you finally manage to fell the large tree, and as expected it has proved just long enough to
