# Adventure_Game_Repo
A basic text based adventure game w/GUI

This is a simple text based adventure game written in Python. I also used Tkinter to build the GUI.
This is my first attempt at a solo project using what little python knowledge I have acquired so far.
I know the code is probably very weak and riddled with errors. However, for all its failings, it has 
taught me a great deal about the python fundamentals, how to utilize the Tkinter library and even forced 
me to deal with a few bugs along the way. The issue of "circular import", in particular, gave me a lot
of trouble.
